simplify
translate, rotate, scale, matrix

for (might execute out of order for speed)
if...elseif...else
-while (nope, no ordered loops)

literals:
numbers (42, 42.3, -4.23, -42.3e5, -4.23e-12, Infinity, -Infinity, NaN)
strings ('abc123', 'abc\'123')
lists ([42,'abc'], [23:42], [23:3:42])
boolean (true,false)
value (undef, null)
